    <h2>July 17th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Similarities between python and scratch are that they both have similar operations and handles data in similar way. They both also contain things such as loops, functions, and user input. Some differences that Python is simpler to use due to the greater number of possible commands and having more control over your program. Debugging the programs was frustrating at times due to the difficulty I had sometimes, but felt good once the problem was fixed. I liked that it forced me to look at the code from the point of view of the computer, and see what would or wouldn't make sense for it. </p>
    
    <h2>July 18th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Some things I learned today included how to effectively use functions to shorten and simplify code. I also used different methods to do things like .isdigit() to check if a string is made of numbers in order to check user input. It was fun and interesting to come together with partners to create an interesting and original story.</p>
    
    <h2>July 19th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Lists are a way to store multiple points of data within one structure. They are useful to use to store and handle similar types of data. You can iterate through lists, manipulate them, and do whatever you need to to solve the problem. The group with only partners worked best in my opinion because we could individually have more control over what was going on and what was happening.</p>
    
    <h2>July 20th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Refinery 29 was interesting because we were able to meet many women in tech. I was cool to see some of what they do in their jobs there.</p>
    
    <h2>July 21th Reflection</h2>
    <p>The python challenges we worked on were pretty straight forward once I figured it out, but adding extra features was a bit more challenging. Working with a partner, Hannah, was very helpful. The hangman challenge was also very unfair since Eddy didn't have anyone else do it. Sad.</p>
    
    <h2>July 24th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Today, being the first day of robotics, was very challenging. I realized that I don't really remember robotics from when I last did it, and I need to review circuts, since I haven't done those in a while. Figuring out how to do switches was a challenge that we were unable to solve after some experimentation. The rest, however, we were able to figure out eventually.</p>
    
    <h2>July 25th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Today was a difficult day, trying to figure out how to add an extra level to our programming. We were eventually able to figure out all the issues that we had (sometimes with help), so we did well with persistance and not giving up on the tasks. In my group, I tended to hog all th work and try to figure things out myself, so one way we could grow would be to focus more on working as a group.</p>
