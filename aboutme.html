    <h2>July 17th Reflection</h2>
    <p>Similarities between python and scratch are that they both have similar operations and handles data in similar way. They both also contain things such as loops, functions, and user input. Some differences that Python is simpler to use due to the greater number of possible commands and having more control over your program. Debugging the programs was frustrating at times due to the difficulty I had sometimes, but felt good once the problem was fixed. I liked that it forced me to look at the code from the point of view of the computer, and see what would or wouldn't make sense for it. </p>

    <p>Some things I learned today included how to effectively use functions to shorten and simplify code. I also used different methods to do things like .isdigit() to check if a string is made of numbers in order to check user input. It was fun and interesting to come together with partners to create an interesting and original story.</p>
