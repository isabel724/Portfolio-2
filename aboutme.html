    <p>Similarities between python and scratch are that they both have similar operations and handles data in similar way. They both also contain things such as loops, functions, and user input. Some differences that Python is simpler to use due to the greater number of possible commands and having more control over your program. Debugging the programs was frustrating at times due to the difficulty I had sometimes, but felt good once the problem was fixed. I liked that it forced me to look at the code from the point of view of the computer, and see what would or wouldn't make sense for it. </p>
